# cifar10Project

The following has been achieved in this project:
1. Multiple DNN, CNN, Transfer Learning Models have been trained using PyTorch and alayzed on CIFAR 10 dataset.
2. A web application has been created using Flask where you can access the 4 models having the highest accuracy on the test set.
3. All code here has been implemented by Chirag Bhuvaneshwara.

Note: The web application has been tested only in debug mode by running it as: python Flask_Web_App.py 
Flask_Web_App.py is found inside CIFAR10_Flask_Web_APP directory.

Accuracy achieved: 

| Models  | Test Accuracy |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Simple DNN  | 42.52%  |
| Simple CNN  | 81.46%  |
| VGG19_bn Net  | 91.06%  |
| Alex Net  | 90.05%  |
| GoogLeNet  | 95.78%  |
| ResNet34  | 96.42%  |
| Inception v3  | * |

*=> I was unable to train because of insufficient VRAM. Probably needs 16GB of VRAM.
